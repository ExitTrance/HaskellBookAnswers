Will they work?

1.  Works and the result is 5. Valid function call, which can be seen
    by looking at the type signature of max: max :: a -> a -> a
    
    max (length [1, 2, 3]) (length [8, 9, 10, 11, 12])


2.  Works. Will return LT as 3*4 < 3*5. 
    
    compare (3 * 4) (3 * 5)


3.  Does not work. Types to be compared need to be the same.
    compare :: a -> -> a -> Ordering
    
    compare "Julie" True


4.  Works, as Num implements an instance of Ord. Result is False.
    (5 + 3) > (3 + 6)



Multiple choice

1. c

2. a

3. a

4. c because divMod and quotRem return a tuple

5. a
