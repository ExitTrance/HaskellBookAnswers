        a) concat [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]         <- CORRECT.

        b) ++ [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6]               <- INCORRECT. ++ is an infix operator. 
           (++) [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6]                Use () to utilize prefix notation. 
        
        c) (++) "hello" " world"                <- CORRECT.
        
        d) ["hello" ++ " world]                 <- INCORRECT. Missing speech mark.
           ["hello" ++ " world"]                

        e) 4 !! "hello"                         <- INCORRECT. Has the type signature of (!!) :: [a] -> Int -> a
           "hello" !! 4                            The List needs to be on the left hand side. 
        
        f) (!!) "hello" 4                       <- CORRECT. Follows the type signature.

        g) take "4 lovely"                      <- INCORRECT. Integer to specify the number of elements, is inside the String.
           take 4 "lovely"                         Place 4 outside of the speech marks.

        h) take 3 "awesome"                     <- CORRECT.
