---- Chapter Exercise [Find the Mistakes]


        1) not True && true                 <- Spelling mistake.
           not True && True

        2) not (x = 6)                      <- Missing =.
           not (x == 6)

        3) (1 * 2) > 5                      <- Correct.

        4) [Merry] > [Happy]                <- Missing speech marks.
           ["Merry"] > ["Happy"]

        5) [1, 2, 3] ++ "look at me!"       <- Cannot concatenate different types.
           ['1', '2', '3'] ++ "look at me!"    Possible fix would be to convert the numbers to chars.
